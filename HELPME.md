## What We Did: Created `bin/setup.ps1`

We created a PowerShell setup script (`bin/setup.ps1`) as a Windows equivalent of the existing `bin/setup.sh` bash script.

### Purpose

Automates the local development environment setup on Windows machines.

### What It Does

1. Checks the installed Python version.
2. Creates a Python virtual environment (`venv/`).
3. Activates the virtual environment.
4. Upgrades pip/wheel and installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
5. Starts a PostgreSQL Docker container (port 5432, database: `accounts`).
6. Verifies the container is running with `docker ps`.

### Usage

```powershell
.\bin\setup.ps1
```

To reactivate the environment later:

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
